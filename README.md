Projects/Challenges I have done using Django

Bluebird Banking
[BluebirdBanking](https://github.com/tylerlynn13/Django_Projects/files/13211494/BluebirdBanking.zip)
Like a checkbook but digital, shows transactions made - type, time, and by who. 

Django University/Campus 
[DjangoUniversityâ€¦]()
Allows user to add/remove classes and campus's. What state they're in, id number, and even professor's.
